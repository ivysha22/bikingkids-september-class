 Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles depending on a device's media type
 such as: screen, print, or speech. They also enable you to apply styles based on specific
 characteristics of the device, like its width, height, resolution, and orientation. For example, you can use media queries to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
    Below is an example of how to use media queries in your CSS:
    ```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
This means: if the screen width is 768px or less, change the background to light blue.
  media queries syntax:
  @media(condition){
  }
  @media starts the rule
  condition is the width height and other features of the device
  small phones:max-width:480px;
  tablets:max-width:768px;
  desktops:min-width:1024px;
    ```
